# Interview Logs

I have this strange obsession with collecting interview/whiteboard questions. Maybe it's the ability to come back to the problem days later and see a different more practical/efficient solution; it never really feels like I'm _done_. In any case, here are a couple of questions I've collected over the past few weeks during my latest job hunt. They're not separated by language since the problems themselves aren't language specific, but not all are written in the same language. Feel free to submit a pull request with your annotated solution in another language.


## How to Whiteboard

An interviewer at Google once laid out some really important tips for whiteboarding. Running through these step with your interviewer helps you move forward with the problem. By asking for the following, you begin to see the many parts of your problem and you can begin mapping what it's going to take tp solve this. It also gives you some canned phrases that show the interviewer that you think about thing like interface and complexity when you code. Win/win.

- Ask for the function signature
  - What are the inputs?
  - What Type are the inputs?
  - What Type is the return?
- Ask for examples
  - Useful because you can turn these into tests
  - If you're on something like Stypi or Coderpad, ALWAYS write your tests first
- Clarify constraints
  - Is the interviewer more concerned with HOW you solve it, or simply THAT you solve it?
  - What complexity is acceptable?
- Talk as much as possible

I've written these out for most of the questions. My hope is that Whiteboarding without this information seems foreign to you and asking for this information is second nature.


## Repo Structure

Challenges will be linked to from this README document. You'll be sent into the `challenges/$CHALLEGE` folder, which will contain its own README, outlying the problem and any constraints and examples. I'll do my best to act as the actual interviewer by only supplying enough information to complete the challenge. Each folder will also contain a solution file. You probably shouldn't look at this until you've given the problem a shot.
