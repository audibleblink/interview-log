# Interview Logs

I have this strange obsession with collecting interview/whiteboard questions.Maybe it's the ability to come back to the problem days later and see a different more practical/efficient solution; it never really feels like I'm _done_. In any case, here a couple of questions I've colledted over the past few weeks during my latest job hunt. They're not separated by language since the problems aren't language specific, but not all are written in the same language. Feel free to submit a pull request with your annotated solution in another language.

## Repo Structure

Challenges will be linked to from this README document. You'll be sent into the `challenges/$CHALLEGE` folder, which will contain its own README, outlying the problem and any constraints and example. I'll do my best to act as the actual interviewer by only supplying enough information to complete the challenge. Each folder will also contain a solution file. You probably shouldn't look at this until you've given the problem a shot.
